Sc(h)izor reading group

‘Sc(h)izor’ Reading Group has been an exercise on developing a reading group format that recycled some online-based notions of dialogue from ‘dialogues.one’, such as ‘talking object’, ‘silence appreciation’, and ‘deep-listening’. This was mixed with a traditional reading group format, where we practiced a host-guest system that unfolded in a series of three sessions where we ‘read’ different media. 

During these three sessions together we hung out while we built up a non-linear journey that constantly echoed the notion of fantasy, or just a ‘pinch’. In its etymological tension between ‘ph’ and ‘f’, from a cognitive development point of view that juxtaposed adultness and childhood, focussing on the nuances traced in relation to, primitive or sophisticated, tendencies towards consumerism. Eclectic parodies on the creative process where validation, copyright, parenthood, exploitation, hauntology, genre, and mental conditions, such as schizophrenia, helped us analyze the nature of human thought processes, economies, and the ethics behind strategies used to influence the masses. All this, and some other things difficult to summarize, was discussed in the anachronistic symbiosis between a philosophical text (2015), a one-shot manga (2022), and a manual for success (1988).
