disclaimer

dear reader, you could think of the collection of links here presented as a fragmented work of literature with different levels of reading and reward to those willing to spend the time needed, we wonder about slow consumption. the diverse pieces here presented have been created with special attention to intimacy and friendship. the overlapping between the national public fund (stimuleringsfonds) and the global economy in which the phenomenon of pokémon fan art is conceived has been considered carefully, any paradox found in the expenditure of the granted fund has been intended to be produced consciously, any discussion generated regarding the expenditure of the granted fund is welcomed and desired.
